    "content": "Jewel Changi’s Forest Valley transforms the airport into a living rainforest, built on sustainable engineering. Over 60,000 climate-adapted plants work to regulate temperature and absorb carbon. With rotating plant displays, the forest landscape constantly evolves, orienting the passenger experience to be engaging, restorative and soothing. The Forest Valley weaves together an experience of nature and marketplace under a communal roof, dramatically echoing Singapore’s reputation as a ‘Garden City’.",
    "funFact": "Greenery covers an area of 21,000–22,000 m² across Jewel Changi Airport, amounting to ~16% of the terminal’s total area.",

    "title": "Singapore's Crown Jewel",
    "content": "As one of the world’s largest indoor gardens, Jewel Changi Airport was originally conceived to expand Terminal 1’s passenger capacity. Creating an airport that integrated operational functionality, sustainability and nature while poising the airport to make global headlines was a massive undertaking, necessitating years of planning and the talent of thousands of professionals. What you see before you now is the crowning engineering achievement of their efforts – Singapore’s ‘Crown Jewel’, featuring a free-form toroidal glass roof, integrated rainwater harvesting system, and climate-controlled indoor forest ecosystem that no other airport in the world can replicate.",
    "funFact": "The entire Forest Valley acts as a natural sound-softener; vegetation naturally absorbs and diffuses noise, reducing echo inside the immense glass dome and giving an unexpectedly calm ambience.",

    "content": "From a small fishing village before 1819, Singapore transformed into a thriving metropolis in just seven decades by maximising land use and turning its people into its greatest resource. Today, it is regularly ranked among the world’s top three financial hubs, with annual trade flows exceeding S$1 trillion despite her inherent lack of natural resources. The Port of Singapore consistently ranks as one of the world’s busiest container ports, and more than 90% of the island’s land is developed or designated for public and economic use, reflecting some of the highest urban land-use efficiency on Earth.",
    "funFact": "Nearly 25% of Singapore’s current land area did not exist in 1960 and was created through land reclamation.",

    "content": "Singapore’s civil aviation story began in 1937 with a modest airport at Kallang. As air travel demand grew, the government recognised the need for larger, modern facilities—leading to the opening of Changi Airport’s Terminal 1 in 1981 and continuous expansion since. Today, Changi is consistently ranked the world’s best airport and handles over 1,000 aircraft movements daily. Its next major milestone, Terminal 5, is designed to accommodate passenger volumes equivalent to the current airport’s entire capacity, reflecting Singapore’s practice of planning aviation growth up to 50 years ahead.",
    "funFact": "Changi Airport was built on reclaimed land over former swamps and the Changi coastline, using sand imported from neighbouring countries.",
